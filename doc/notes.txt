Started with "Big Picture" by Simon Allardice

Moved on TypeScript Getting Started

we'd need npm -> we need Node.js isntalled or upgraded

> choco upgrade nodejs

install typescript n save it as a dev dependency
from pwsh embeddded in vscode
> npm install typescript --save-dev

due to --save-dev we now have a newer entry in package.json under devDependencies

since I did a local install of tsc i.e. without -g switch, I had to then add it to my PATH 
D:\github\ts_gs\node_modules\.bin

then I can move to any folder with .ts in it and compile using
> tsc 

this creates my .js files which can then be used in html via src tag

finally to start the server i.e. make Node serve our pages on localhost port 8080 we move to project root
> npm start
now we can browse to localhost:8080

*************

Now I need a tsconfig.json to specify to tsc compiler how i want it to behave. typescriptlang.org has plenty on it

> tsc -v
> tsc -h
> tsc --init

now i have specified some settings for tsc to adhere to.

Mod3: Built-in Types
************************************************************
- backticks ` around a string mean that you can use ${varName} just like C#
- Types in TS are an optional feature because you can declare a variable as 'Any' 
  which means exhibit JS behaviour
- --strictNullChecks compiler option means 'null' + 'undefined' cannot be assigned to any type of variable
  to explicity allow this for a type we use a union
  e.g. let nullableString : null | string;

************************************************************
Mod 4: Functions
************************************************************
- function func(name : string, age ?: number)
? means optional param

- noImplicitAny flag enforces type safety in function parameters

- function func(name : string, age : number = 42) means default will be used if
 age is not passed at all or passed as undefined when invokin func

- arrow functions are mostly used where a function expects a function as one of its input params

. TS functions are much better than JS functions because of type annotations. Easier to read n less prone to bugs

************************************************************
Mod 5: Custom types 
************************************************************
- an interface can 'extend' an existing interface just like a class can extend another class
a class implements an interface using 'implements' keyword 

- TS type system is structural. Duck typing. If something walks and quacks like a duck it better be a duck.

- interfaces are used for compile time type checking by the compiler and do not translate into any real code
evidence: 
projRoot> .\node_modules\.bin\tsc .\src\app\person.ts
the generated person.js file is completely empty

- Acessor methods (getters n setters) syntax is just like any other method plus get n set
unlike C# this keyword is mandatory when accessing internal properties inside a class

- an interface can be directly implemented by an object literal though u'd normally use a class implementing an
interface and new up an instance

- using tsc to compile mutiple src files to a specfied output directory
.\node_modules\.bin\tsc .\src\app\person.ts .\src\app\player.ts .\src\app\app.ts --outDir ".\dist\"

- typing 'ref' at the top of a file is a mechnism to add refs => telling tsc to fetch the referenced code before compiling this file

- in your tsconfig, you cna use 'outFile' to bundle everything together in a single file instead fo creating mutiple files after compilation
