Moved on TypeScript Getting Started

we'd need npm -> we need Node.js isntalled or upgraded

> choco upgrade nodejs

install typescript n save it as a dev dependency
from pwsh embeddded in vscode
> npm install typescript --save-dev

due to --save-dev we now have a newer entry in package.json under devDependencies

since I did a local install of tsc i.e. without -g switch, I had to then add it to my PATH 
D:\github\ts_gs\node_modules\.bin

then I can move to any folder with .ts in it and compile using
> tsc 

this creates my .js files which can then be used in html via src tag

finally to start the server i.e. make Node serve our pages on localhost port 8080 we move to project root
> npm start
now we can browse to localhost:8080

*************

Now I need a tsconfig.json to specify to tsc compiler how i want it to behave. typescriptlang.org has plenty on it

> tsc -v
> tsc -h
> tsc --init
